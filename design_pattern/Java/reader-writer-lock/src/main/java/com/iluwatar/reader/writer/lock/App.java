/**
 * 
 * In a multiple thread applications, the threads may try to synchronize the shared resources
 * regardless of read or write operation. It leads to a low performance especially in a "read more
 * write less" system as indeed the read operations are thread-safe to another read operation.
 * <p>
 * Reader writer lock is a synchronization primitive that try to resolve this problem. This pattern
 * allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations require exclusive
 * access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but an exclusive lock is
 * needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data, all other writers or
 * readers will be blocked until the writer is finished writing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This example use two mutex to demonstrate the concurrent access of multiple readers and writers.
