 * implements the same interface as the target and uses aggregation to "decorate" calls to the
 * target. Using the Decorator pattern it is possible to change the behavior of the class during
 * runtime.
 * <p>
 * In this example we show how the simple {@link SimpleTroll} first attacks and then flees the battle.
 * Then we decorate the {@link SimpleTroll} with a {@link ClubbedTroll} and perform the attack again. You
 * can see how the behavior changes after the decoration.
