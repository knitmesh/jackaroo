/**
 * 
 * Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web
 * applications. Flux eschews MVC in favor of a unidirectional data flow. When a user interacts with
 * a React view, the view propagates an action through a central dispatcher, to the various stores
 * that hold the application's data and business logic, which updates all of the views that are
 * affected.
 * <p>
 * This example has two views: menu and content. They represent typical main menu and content area
 * of a web page. When menu item is clicked it triggers events through the dispatcher. The events
 * are received and handled by the stores updating their data as needed. The stores then notify the
 * views that they should rerender themselves.
