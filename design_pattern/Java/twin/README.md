## Intent
 Twin pattern is a design pattern which provides a standard solution to simulate multiple
inheritance in java

![alt text](./etc/twin.png "Twin")

## Applicability
Use the Twin idiom when

* to simulate multiple inheritance in a language that does not support this feature.
* to avoid certain problems of multiple inheritance such as name clashes.
