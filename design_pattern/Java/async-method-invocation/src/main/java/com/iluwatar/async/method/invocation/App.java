/**
 * This application demonstrates the async method invocation pattern. Key parts of the pattern are
 * <code>AsyncResult</code> which is an intermediate container for an asynchronously evaluated value,
 * <code>AsyncCallback</code> which can be provided to be executed on task completion and <code>AsyncExecutor</code>
 * that manages the execution of the async tasks.
 * <p>
 * The main method shows example flow of async invocations. The main thread starts multiple tasks with variable
 * durations and then continues its own work. When the main thread has done it's job it collects the results of the
 * async tasks. Two of the tasks are handled with callbacks, meaning the callbacks are executed immediately when the
 * tasks complete.
 * <p>
 * Noteworthy difference of thread usage between the async results and callbacks is that the async results are collected
 * in the main thread but the callbacks are executed within the worker threads. This should be noted when working with
 * thread pools.
 * <p>
 * Java provides its own implementations of async method invocation pattern. FutureTask, CompletableFuture and
 * ExecutorService are the real world implementations of this pattern. But due to the nature of parallel programming,
 * the implementations are not trivial. This example does not take all possible scenarios into account but rather
 * provides a simple version that helps to understand the pattern.
