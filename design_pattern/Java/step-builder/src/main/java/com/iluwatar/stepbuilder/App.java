/**
 * Step Builder Pattern
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Intent</b> <br/>
 * An extension of the Builder pattern that fully guides the user through the creation of the object
 * with no chances of confusion. <br/>
 * The user experience will be much more improved by the fact that he will only see the next step
 * methods available, NO build method until is the right time to build the object.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation</b>
 * <ul>
 * The concept is simple:
 *
 * <li>Write creational steps inner classes or interfaces where each method knows what can be
 * displayed next.</li>
 *
 * <li>Implement all your steps interfaces in an inner static class.</li>
 *
 * <li>Last step is the BuildStep, in charge of creating the object you need to build.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Applicability</b> <br/>
 * Use the Step Builder pattern when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be
 * independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled the construction
 * process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed when in the
 * process of constructing the order is important.
 * <p>
