/**
 * 
 * Model-View-Controller is a pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides the application
 * into three interconnected parts namely the model, the view and the controller.
 * <p>
 * The central component of MVC, the model, captures the behavior of the application in terms of its
 * problem domain, independent of the user interface. The model directly manages the data, logic and
 * rules of the application. A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart
 * or a diagram The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the
 * model or view.
 * <p>
 * In this example we have a giant ({@link GiantModel}) with statuses for health, fatigue and
 * nourishment. {@link GiantView} can display the giant with its current status.
 * {@link GiantController} receives input affecting the model and delegates redrawing the giant to
 * the view.
