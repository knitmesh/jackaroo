## Also known as
CompletableFuture

## Intent
A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It
allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or 
failure reason. Promises are a way to write async code that still appears as though it is executing 
in a synchronous way.

## Applicability
Promise pattern is applicable in concurrent programming when some work needs to be done asynchronously
and:

* code maintainablity and readability suffers due to callback hell.
* you need to compose promises and need better error handling for asynchronous tasks.
* you want to use functional style of programming.
