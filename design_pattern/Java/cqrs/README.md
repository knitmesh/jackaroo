## Intent
CQRS Command Query Responsibility Segregation - Separate the query side from the command side.

![alt text](./etc/cqrs.png "CQRS")

## Applicability
Use the CQRS pattern when

* you want to scale the queries and commands independently.
* you want to use different data models for queries and commands. Useful when dealing with complex domains.
* you want to use architectures like event sourcing or task based UI.
