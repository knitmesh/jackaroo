 * The Strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern that enables
 * an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
 * <p>
 * Before Java 8 the Strategies needed to be separate classes forcing the developer
 * to write lots of boilerplate code. With modern Java it is easy to pass behavior
 * with method references and lambdas making the code shorter and more readable.
 * <p>
 * In this example ({@link DragonSlayingStrategy}) encapsulates an algorithm. The containing object
 * ({@link DragonSlayer}) can alter its behavior by changing its strategy.
