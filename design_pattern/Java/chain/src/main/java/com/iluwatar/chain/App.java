/**

 * The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of command objects and a
 * series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of
 * command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the
 * chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain.
 * <p>
 * In this example we organize the request handlers ({@link RequestHandler}) into a chain where each
 * handler has a chance to act on the request on its turn. Here the king ({@link OrcKing}) makes
 * requests and the military orcs ({@link OrcCommander}, {@link OrcOfficer}, {@link OrcSoldier})
 * form the handler chain.
