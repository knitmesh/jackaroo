## Intent
Using empty interfaces as markers to distinguish special treated objects.

![alt text](./etc/MarkerDiagram.png "Marker Interface")

## Applicability
Use the Marker Interface pattern when

* you want to identify the special objects from normal objects (to treat them differently)
* you want to mark that some object is available for certain sort of operations
