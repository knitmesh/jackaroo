## Also known as
* Ports and Adapters
* Clean Architecture

## Intent
Allow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.

## Applicability
Use Hexagonal Architecture pattern when

* When the application needs to be independent of any frameworks
* When it is important that the application highly maintainable and fully testable

## Tutorials

## Presentations
* [Hexagonal Architecture](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/hexagonal/etc/presentation.html)

## Real world examples

* [Apache Isis](https://isis.apache.org/) builds generic UI and REST API directly from the underlying domain objects
