/**
 * 
 * The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand
 * because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is
 * unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler
 * interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class which contains a set of
 * members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and
 * hide the implementation details.
 * <p>
 * In this example the Facade is ({@link DwarvenGoldmineFacade}) and it provides a simpler interface
 * to the goldmine subsystem.
